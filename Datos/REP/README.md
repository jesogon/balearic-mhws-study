## Where does the data come from?

The satelitte data seems to come from Marine Data Store of Corpernicus Marine Service.

## Overview

The Reprocessed (REP) Mediterranean (MED) dataset provides a stable and consistent long-term Sea Surface Temperature (SST) time series over the Mediterranean Sea (and the adjacent North Atlantic box) developed for climate applications. This product consists of daily (nighttime), optimally interpolated (L4), satellite-based estimates of the foundation SST (namely, the temperature free, or nearly-free, of any diurnal cycle) at 0.05° resolution grid covering the period from 1st January 1981 to present (approximately one month before real time). The MED-REP-L4 product is built from a consistent reprocessing of the collated level-3 (merged single-sensor, L3C) climate data record (CDR) v.3.0, provided by the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and covering the period up to 2021, and its interim extension (ICDR) that allows the regular temporal extension for 2022 onwards.
