# <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Balearic MHWs study </h1>

This repository contains all the code used to produce figures for the master thesis entitled “Marine heatwaves in the Balearic Islands region”.

Please note that the repository is not in its final state. Modifications for enhancing the code readability are planned during the whole month of September 2025.

## What is in here?

 - `Codigos/` :
     Code used to compute MHW metrics and produce figures from them.

 - `Datos/` :
     Data used by the code (namely, temperature and bathymetry data).

 - `Documentos/` :
     Folder containing the original master thesis report and presentation using the code herein.

## How should this code be runned?

See the `README.md` inside the Codigos folder for more details. 

## External files

For most of the code here, external files are expected, namely data files. Due to the large size of those files, they are not included in the GitHub repository.

See the `README.md` inside the Datos folder for more details.
